- 👋 Hi, I’m @OxygenoiD
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about Android development and how code can create such amazing platforms that are able to accomplish such huge work loads. 
- I'm currently learning more than I can process without having a partner or community to ask for help. I'm all over the place, instead of buckling down in one's area. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of project or objective, work with someone or a group. I would be willing to help with anything and offer as much time as needed for the opportunity to gain more experience. 
- 📫 How to reach me, best way is Gmail. xoxygengx@gmail.com
- 💡 Please put, $Github$ inside the subject box. Otherwise I will most likely look over your email.
